# Urban Air Quality Index Modeler
## SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities


## 1. Introduction

Urban air pollution is a growing concern in rapidly developing cities, posing serious health and environmental challenges. Among various pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is particularly harmful because it can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular problems.

Traffic congestion and meteorological conditions, such as wind speed, significantly influence PM2.5 concentration levels. Predicting PM2.5 levels using machine learning models can help city planners and policymakers take proactive measures to reduce pollution exposure and improve public health.

This project aims to develop a predictive regression model that estimates PM2.5 concentrations based on traffic volume and wind speed data. By identifying patterns and trends, the model supports data-driven urban planning and contributes toward achieving **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**.


## 2. Problem Statement

To design and implement a predictive model capable of estimating PM2.5 concentration levels based on traffic volume and wind speed data, while incorporating temporal patterns through Hour-of-Day feature engineering.


## 3. Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between traffic volume, wind speed, and PM2.5 levels  
- Perform feature engineering by extracting Hour-of-Day from timestamp data  
- Train and evaluate regression models for PM2.5 prediction  
- Generate insights that support sustainable urban air quality management
